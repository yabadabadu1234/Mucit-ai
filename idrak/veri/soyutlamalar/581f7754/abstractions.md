# Task 581f7754 Abstractions

- **identity** – pass-through baseline that keeps the grid unchanged; failed all train cases (0/3, first failure train[0]).
- **column_anchor** – translates connected components so each anchor colour lies on a common column but skips row refinement; solved 2/3 train cases (first failure train[1]).
- **full_alignment** – column anchoring plus row-based compression toward anchor rows, matching all train samples (3/3) and producing the delivered test outputs.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `groupByAnchorColor : Grid -> Dict[Color, List Component]` — collect components keyed by their anchor colour.
  - `alignColumnsToAnchor : Dict[Color, List Component] -> Dict[Color, List Component]` — translate each group so anchors share a common column.
  - `compressRowsTowardAnchor : Dict[Color, List Component] -> Dict[Color, List Component]` — collapse rows within each group toward the designated anchor row.
  - `renderAlignedComponents : Grid × Dict[Color, List Component] -> Grid` — draw the aligned and compressed components back onto the canvas.
- **Solver summary**: "Group components by anchor colour, align their columns, compress rows toward the anchors, and render the aligned components."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_581f7754(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    grouped = groupByAnchorColor(grid)
    column_aligned = alignColumnsToAnchor(grouped)
    row_compressed = compressRowsTowardAnchor(column_aligned)
    return renderAlignedComponents(grid, row_compressed)
```
