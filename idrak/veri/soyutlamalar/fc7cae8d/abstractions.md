# fc7cae8d Abstraction Report

- `identity`: Baseline copy of the input grid; leaves the oversized canvas untouched and therefore misses all targets (0/3 train solved).
- `rotate_ccw`: Crop the largest interior component and rotate it 90° counter-clockwise; resolves two training grids but misorients the asymmetric instance (2/3 solved, first miss train[0]).
- `rotate_ccw_flip`: Same crop with a forced horizontal mirror after rotation; fixes the asymmetric case but breaks the symmetric ones (1/3 solved, first miss train[1]).
- `rotate_ccw_column_heuristic`: Apply the rotation and flip only when the dominant color is heavier on the right edge; keeps the asymmetric example aligned while preserving the symmetric grids (3/3 solved, no failures). This heuristic matches the final solver shipped in `analysis/arc2_samples/fc7cae8d.py` and is used for the test inference.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `selectInteriorComponent : Grid -> Component` — find the largest non-background component, preferring ones that do not touch the border.
  - `cropComponent : Grid × Component -> Grid` — extract the component’s bounding box.
  - `rotateCounterClockwise : Grid -> Grid` — rotate the cropped patch 90° counter-clockwise.
  - `conditionalMirror : Grid × Color -> Grid` — compare dominant-colour counts on the left/right edges and mirror when the right edge is heavier.
- **Solver summary**: "Pick the main interior component, crop it, rotate the crop, then mirror horizontally when the dominant colour is concentrated on the right edge."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_fc7cae8d(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    component = selectInteriorComponent(grid)
    cropped = cropComponent(grid, component)
    rotated = rotateCounterClockwise(cropped)
    return conditionalMirror(rotated, component.color)
```
