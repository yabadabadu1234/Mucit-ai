# b5ca7ac4 Abstraction Summary

- **identity** – left the grid untouched; serves as the baseline and unsurprisingly scored 0/3 on the training cases.
- **lane_pack_naive** – detected 5x5 ring objects and pushed both outer-color groups straight to their respective borders without any lane preference; collided objects and likewise failed 0/3.
- **lane_pack_threshold** – reused the same object detection but steered the right-border group by comparing original x-positions against their mean before falling back to the alternate lane on conflicts; achieved 3/3 on train, produced 22×22 outputs for the test case, and matches the solver in `arc2_samples/b5ca7ac4.py`.

The successful refinement preserves each object's original vertical placement, routes higher outer colors to the left border, and alternates/right-justifies the lower-color rings so that no two overlap, yielding the exact training labels and a coherent arrangement on the held-out test input.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `detectRingObjects : Grid -> List Ring` — find 5×5 ring motifs, capturing inner/outer colours, bounding boxes, and patterns.
  - `constructLanes : Grid × List Ring -> LanePlan` — compute background colour and produce left/right lane positions based on ring size and canvas width.
  - `assignRingLanes : List Ring × LanePlan -> LanePlacements` — order rings by outer colour, choose preferred lanes, and resolve conflicts by falling back to alternate lanes.
  - `renderRingPlacements : Grid × LanePlacements × Color -> Grid` — paint each ring pattern into its assigned lane on a background canvas, preserving canvas size.
- **Solver summary**: "Detect the ring objects, build left/right lane positions, assign each ring to a non-overlapping lane with conflict resolution, and render the repositioned rings onto the canvas."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_b5ca7ac4(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    rings = detectRingObjects(grid)
    lane_plan = constructLanes(grid, rings)
    placements = assignRingLanes(rings, lane_plan)
    return renderRingPlacements(grid, placements, lane_plan.background)
```
