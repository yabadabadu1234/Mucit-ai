# Task 4c3d4a41 Abstractions

- `overlay_only`: zeroes the left wedge and mirrors its 5s onto the right via a fixed offset. It misses the upward shift of the right-side digits (train 0/2).
- `copy_second_row_then_overlay`: additionally copies the third row's right block into the second row before mirroring, fixing the first training case but failing when deeper rows introduce new colors (train 1/2).
- `shift_rows_with_left_presence`: copies each right block upward wherever the source row still carries left-wedge 5s, then mirrors the wedge; this matches both training examples (2/2) and is the final solver.

The final strategy layers the selective upward copy with the mirroring step, producing the published solver in `arc2_samples/4c3d4a41.py`.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `locateLeftWedge : Grid -> List Cell` — identify exact left-wedge cells of colour `5` (left of the split column).
  - `extractRightBlocks : Grid × List Cell -> List Row` — derive source rows whose right-hand blocks should shift upward.
  - `shiftBlocksUpwards : Grid × List Row -> Grid` — copy each source row’s right block one row above.
  - `mirrorWedge : Grid × List Cell -> Grid` — zero the left region and mirror the wedge cells onto the right.
- **Solver summary**: "Find the wedge cells, shift right blocks up for their rows, then mirror the wedge positions and clear the left region."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_4c3d4a41(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    wedge_cells = locateLeftWedge(grid)
    blocks = extractRightBlocks(grid, wedge_cells)
    shifted = shiftBlocksUpwards(grid, blocks)
    return mirrorWedge(shifted, wedge_cells)
```
