# ARC Task 88bcf3b4 – Abstraction Summary

- **identity**: Directly copies the input grid. Serves as a sanity baseline; fails immediately (train[0], pixel ≈ 92%).
- **path_projection**: Detects the anchor column, adjacent accent mass, and nearest target component, then draws a monotone king-move path governed by approach/plateau/departure heuristics. Achieves 100% exact matches on the train split and produces well-structured predictions for the evaluation inputs.

Final solver uses `path_projection` alone—the identity baseline only informed the initial failure pattern. The path abstraction captures the observed diagonal-to-plateau geometry around the target component and respects boundary constraints, matching all labelled examples.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `classifyColumns : Grid -> (Color, Color)` — detect the anchor column colour and adjacent accent colour by scanning column components.
  - `locateContactAndStart : Grid × Color × Color -> (Cell, Cell, Color, Set Cell, Int)` — find the accent contact point next to the anchor and choose the starting component for the path.
  - `generatePath : Grid × Cell × Cell × Set Cell × Int × Color -> List Cell` — compute the monotone king-move path following approach/plateau/departure heuristics.
  - `rewritePath : Grid × Set Cell × List Cell -> Grid` — clear the original accent cells and draw the generated path onto the grid.
- **Solver summary**: "Identify the anchor and accent columns, locate the contact/starting cells, generate the king-move path according to the learned heuristics, and redraw the accent along that path."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_88bcf3b4(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    anchor_color, accent_color = classifyColumns(grid)
    contact, start, start_color, accent_cells, anchor_x = locateContactAndStart(grid, anchor_color, accent_color)
    path_cells = generatePath(grid, contact, start, accent_cells, anchor_x, start_color)
    return rewritePath(grid, accent_cells, path_cells)
```
