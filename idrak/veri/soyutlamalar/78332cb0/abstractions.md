Task 78332cb0 Abstraction Report
--------------------------------

- `row_major_stack`: Segment tiles with the separator color and stack them in row-major order without reorientation; hits 1/3 train cases because blocks need rotation before stacking.
- `rotated_cycle`: Rotate the block grid clockwise, cycle the starting tile, and reassemble with separator rows/columns; matches 3/3 train cases and produces structured outputs on both test grids (tall stack for test[0], wide strip for test[1]).

Final pipeline: use `rotated_cycle`, which respects tile orientation and separator placement; manual inspection of its two test predictions shows the digit tiles preserved with clean 6-lines between them.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `detectSeparatorColor : Grid -> Color` — identify the colour that forms full separator rows or columns.
  - `segmentIntoBlocks : Grid × Color -> List List Block` — partition the grid into tile blocks by cutting along separator rows/columns.
  - `rotateAndCycleBlocks : List List Block -> (List Block, Orientation)` — rotate the block grid clockwise and cycle starting positions to choose vertical vs. horizontal stacking.
  - `assembleBlocks : List Block × Orientation × Color -> Grid` — stitch the ordered blocks back together, inserting separator rows or columns.
- **Solver summary**: "Detect the separator colour, cut the grid into blocks, rotate/cycle the blocks to choose the stack orientation, and assemble them with separator lines."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_78332cb0(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    separator = detectSeparatorColor(grid)
    blocks = segmentIntoBlocks(grid, separator)
    ordered_blocks, orientation = rotateAndCycleBlocks(blocks)
    return assembleBlocks(list(ordered_blocks), orientation, separator)
```
