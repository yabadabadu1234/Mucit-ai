# edb79dae Abstractions

- **primary_only** – expands each digit block using only the inferred target colour. It reaches 1/2 training cases because the lack of masking smears the digits and fails on the second example.
- **template_fill** – decodes the legend templates (mask + primary colour) and renders each block accordingly. It matches both training puzzles and is used in the final solver. The same pipeline produces a 21×21 answer for the evaluation input that preserves the layered frame structure while recolouring the digits.

The final solution combines automatic block-size detection, legend decoding and template-based rendering to recover both the palette mapping and the positional masks before repainting the region bounded by colour 5.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `findLegendROI : Grid × Color -> Box` — compute the bounding box around the colour-5 frame.
  - `inferBlockSize : Grid × Box × Set Color -> Int` — scan interior runs to infer the digit block size while skipping legend/background colours.
  - `decodeDigitTemplates : Grid × Box × Int -> DigitTemplates` — extract masks and primary/secondary palette assignments for each digit colour.
  - `renderDigitBlocks : Grid × Box × Int × DigitTemplates -> Grid` — tile each block group with the decoded masks and palette choices, returning the repainted ROI.
- **Solver summary**: "Locate the colour-5 frame, infer the digit block size, decode each digit’s mask and repaint colours from the legend, then render the region using those templates."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_edb79dae(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    roi = findLegendROI(grid, 5)
    r0, _, c0, _ = roi
    legend_colours = set(
        colour
        for r in range(r0)
        for colour in grid[r]
    )
    block_size = inferBlockSize(grid, roi, legend_colours)
    templates = decodeDigitTemplates(grid, roi, block_size)
    return renderDigitBlocks(grid, roi, block_size, templates)
```
