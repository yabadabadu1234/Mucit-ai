- `identity`: baseline that copies the input; 0/2 train cases solved, fails immediately on train[0].
- `two_color_parity`: enforces an alternating two-color pattern inside the ring; reaches 1/2 on train (train[1] still breaks because of three-color stripes).
- `majority_periodic`: majority-vote periodic repair of each inner row (period ≤6); 2/2 train cases solved and becomes the final refinement.

No test or arc_gen samples were available for evaluation.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `detectInnerSegment : Row -> Segment` — locate the interior slice excluding border/walkway colours.
  - `enumeratePatterns : Segment -> List Pattern` — generate repeating patterns up to period 6 for that slice.
  - `scorePattern : Segment × Pattern -> Score` — evaluate mismatch and tie-breakers for a candidate pattern.
  - `selectBestPattern : List Pattern -> Pattern` — pick the lowest-score pattern.
  - `tileSegment : Row × Pattern -> Row` — overwrite the interior slice with the repeating pattern.
- **Solver summary**: "For each row, isolate the inner slice, find the dominant repeating pattern (period ≤ 6) by mismatch score, and retile that slice accordingly."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_135a2760(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    def fixRow(row: Row) -> Row:
        segment = detectInnerSegment(row)
        patterns = enumeratePatterns(segment)
        best = selectBestPattern(patterns)
        return tileSegment(row, best)
    
    return [fixRow(row) for row in grid]
```
