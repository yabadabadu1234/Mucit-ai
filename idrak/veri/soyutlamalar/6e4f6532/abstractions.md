# ARC Task 6e4f6532 – Abstractions Summary

- **identity** – Baseline that returns the input unchanged; serves as a control and unsurprisingly scores 0/2 on train cases.
- **heuristic_orientation** – Attempted to rotate shapes by matching their 9-cells to marker positions; partial alignment but still mismatched colors, yielding 0/2 matches.
- **canonical_template** – Uses the templates learned from train outputs (now implemented in the solver); reproduces the motifs around each marker and achieves 2/2 train accuracy.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `extractComponents : Grid -> List Component` — describe every non-background component with its colour counts, bounding box, and embedded block.
  - `splitObjectsAndMarkers : List Component -> (List Object, List Marker)` — separate multi-colour figures from 9-only marker columns and group markers by size.
  - `lookupPattern : Component -> Optional Pattern` — match the component’s colour histogram against the precomputed pattern table.
  - `stampPatternAtMarker : Grid × Pattern × Marker -> Grid` — clear the object’s original cells, then stamp the pattern relative to the marker anchor.
  
- **Solver summary**: "Extract components, split figures from markers, look up the template that matches each figure’s colour counts, and stamp that pattern at the associated marker."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_6e4f6532(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    components = extractComponents(grid)
    objects, markers = splitObjectsAndMarkers(components)
    entries = list(zip(objects, markers))

    def stamp(canvas: Grid, entry: Tuple[dict, dict]) -> Grid:
        obj, marker = entry
        pattern = lookupPattern(obj)
        return stampPatternAtMarker(canvas, pattern, marker) if pattern is not None else canvas

    return fold_repaint(grid, entries, stamp)
```
